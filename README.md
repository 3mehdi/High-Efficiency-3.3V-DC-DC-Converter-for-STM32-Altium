# High-Efficiency-3.3V-DC-DC-Converter-for-STM32-Altium



This schematic is for a 3.3V DC-DC switching converter using the LM2576-3.3V IC. The converter can accept an input voltage of 7 to 40 V and output up to 3 A of current. It is suitable for designs that use STM32 microcontrollers or other 3.3V-powered devices.

The schematic is relatively simple, with the LM2576-3.3V IC at the heart of the circuit. The IC is a buck converter, which means that it reduces the input voltage to the desired output voltage. The input voltage is applied to the input pins of the IC, and the output voltage is available on the output pins.

The schematic also includes a few additional components to protect the IC and improve efficiency.
